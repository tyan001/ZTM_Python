# Python Notes & Exercises

This repository contains my notes and exercises for the ZTM Python Developer course.

At some point (Functional Section), I learned that you can do cell like coding in the .py files using the #%% syntax and just started using it that way. This is super useful when using IDEs like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, as it allows you to run code in chunks, similar to Jupyter Notebooks.
